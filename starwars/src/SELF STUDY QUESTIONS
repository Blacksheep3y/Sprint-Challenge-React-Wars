 What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is basically a library that allows you to build reusable components rendered in a virtual DOM and it basically tries to solve problems with making code as DRY as possible, as well as making code adaptable.

 What does it mean to think in react?

Basically breaking down the process of building web apps with Javascript/React by starting with a mock, breaking the UI into a component hierarchy, building a static verison in react, Identifying the minimal representation of the UI state, Finding where your state should exist, and Adding inverse data flow.

 Describe state.

In the React sense, “state” is an object that represents the parts of the app that can change. Each component can maintain its own state, which lives in an object called this

 Describe props.

“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another. Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.
 
 What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

 Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components are all examples of side effects
